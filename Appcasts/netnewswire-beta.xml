            <title>NetNewsWire 6.1.2</title>
            <description><![CDATA[
            <p><b>Twitter integration has been removed:</b> Twitter has suspended NetNewsWire, and Twitter is removing free access to the Twitter API</p>
            <p>Since Twitter does not provide RSS feeds, we’ve had to use the Twitter API. Without free access to that API, we can’t read feeds from Twitter.</p>
            <p>We’ve left your Twitter feeds intact. If you have any starred items from those feeds, they will remain as long as you don’t delete those feeds.</p>
            <p>You can still read whatever you have already downloaded. However, those feeds will no longer update.</p>
            <p>Other changes…</p>
            <p>Fixed a crashing bug that could happen in the sidebar</p>
            <p>Fixed a bug that could prevent users from accessing BazQux if an article was missing a field</p>
            <p>Fixed an issue that could prevent Feedly users from syncing if they tried to mark too many articles as read at the same time</p>
            <p>Updated the Safari extension icon (credit to Louie Mantia for the new icon)</p>
